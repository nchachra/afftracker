* For shareasale, affiliatewindow, show merchant name rather than the code.
* Switch background to event pages, this is not cool bro
* Identify failed cookie stuffing events using URL patterns.
* Convert to Chrome App because curiosity and dead cat.
* Some URLs of the form .*/?ref=<number> are affiliate URLs
* Some sites have other cookies that might have some useful info. Like Hostgator has one for instance. Consider later.
* Popular cookie names identifiable by patterns that I am currently not catching:
  usref (vip-prom.net)
  ej_aff_id54585 - 26394
  jinxAffiliate=1356
  BDV_AFF_ID=4
  blogadd=joneslow174
  aff24h=5252696
  aref=12026 aref=none aref=794798
* We are cleaning up rather well, but still maybe tie callbacks to cookies so that when they are deleted, local storage object is deleted too.
* In cases of 301 redirect (Moved Permanently), Chrome redirects to the new page which has a new request id, which in turn may issues requests for the page that actually does cookie stuffing. I've seen examples of this and in these casese, we never really find out the referer chain. One way to do it would be to always hold a mapping of "url": "referer", and then when we create a request chain and find that our url was referred to, combine objects. Otherwise, have timers to delete the url: referer mappings. Kind of complicated, maybe useful though. One example is 00o00.blogspot.com which leads to http://www.whats-he-wearing.com/ which is the site that stuffs for linkshare.


NOTES:
These are included in the above but might be useful later.
  * joyo.com redirects to amazon.cn
  * kindle.amazon.com
  * amazonsupply.com
  * wireless.amazon.com
  * aws.amazon.com
  * webstore.amazon.com
  * local.amazon.com
  * askville.amazon.com\/(Index.do)?$/;
  * webstore.amazon.co.uk\/?$/;
  * local.amazon.co.uk\/?$/;

I have seen "referer" cookie used sometimes to store affilate
ID, but this is rare. It seems to store the actual referrer
almost always. As a result, I am not including it in the cookie
Regex.
