* Switch background to event pages, this is not cool bro
* add the image/frame dimensions to the data.
* send dom content.


Low Pri:
* Make all merchant icons be the same size.
* Identify failed cookie stuffing events using URL patterns.

High Pri:
* godaddy example:   //?isc=cjcho199a&utm_campaign=affiliates_cj_199hst&utm_source=Commission%20Junction&utm_medium=External%2BAffil&utm_content=cjcho199a&cvosrc=affiliate.cj.PID
* Looks like pop overs/unders aren't held well. It does not identify the page user had visited. For example, visit http://thishitseasy.blogspot.com/. It knows the cookie, but doesn't know which page gave user the cookie :(
* For pages like http://www.smartincome.org/ not everything is being submitted. Requests are being throttled: http://dev.chromium.org/throttling
* use email feedback to fix up/refactor.

I have seen "referer" cookie used sometimes to store affilate
ID, but this is rare. It seems to store the actual referrer
almost always. As a result, I am not including it in the cookie
Regex.
