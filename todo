Low Pri:
* Switch background to event pages, this is not cool bro
* Make all merchant icons be the same size.
* Identify failed cookie stuffing events using URL patterns.
* Convert to Chrome App because curiosity and dead cat.
* Some URLs of the form .*/?ref=<number> are affiliate URLs
* Some sites have other cookies that might have some useful info. Like Hostgator has one for instance. Consider later.
* Popular cookie names identifiable by patterns that I am currently not catching:
  usref (vip-prom.net)
  ej_aff_id54585 - 26394
  jinxAffiliate=1356
  BDV_AFF_ID=4
  blogadd=joneslow174
  aff24h=5252696
  aref=12026 aref=none aref=794798


High Pri:
* send dom content.
* add the image/frame dimensions to the data.
* godaddy example:   //?isc=cjcho199a&utm_campaign=affiliates_cj_199hst&utm_source=Commission%20Junction&utm_medium=External%2BAffil&utm_content=cjcho199a&cvosrc=affiliate.cj.PID
* Looks like pop overs/unders aren't held well. It does not identify the page user had visited. For example, visit http://thishitseasy.blogspot.com/. It knows the cookie, but doesn't know which page gave user the cookie :(
* For pages like http://www.smartincome.org/ not everything is being submitted. Requests are being throttled: http://dev.chromium.org/throttling
* use email feedback to fix up/refactor.
* Testing
* Option to delete cookies


Notes:
These are included in the above but might be useful later.
  * joyo.com redirects to amazon.cn
  * kindle.amazon.com
  * amazonsupply.com
  * wireless.amazon.com
  * aws.amazon.com
  * webstore.amazon.com
  * local.amazon.com
  * askville.amazon.com\/(Index.do)?$/;
  * webstore.amazon.co.uk\/?$/;
  * local.amazon.co.uk\/?$/;

I have seen "referer" cookie used sometimes to store affilate
ID, but this is rare. It seems to store the actual referrer
almost always. As a result, I am not including it in the cookie
Regex.
